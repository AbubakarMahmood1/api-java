# Requirements
- The web API should demonstrate linear scalability up to 10 million concurrent users with response times increasing proportionately.
- The web API shall utilize no more than 80% of available server CPU and memory resources under peak load.
- The web API will maintain a 99.9% success rate for requests under a sustained load of 5 times the average daily peak traffic.
- The round-trip latency for API requests shall not exceed 100 milliseconds for 99% of requests.
- The web API should have a documented and tested capacity plan, detailing how it will handle a 50% increase in traffic within a 3-month period.
-  The web API shall undergo peak load testing to validate performance at 150% of expected peak usage.
- The web API should release resources promptly after processing requests, ensuring that unused resources are deallocated within 5 seconds.
